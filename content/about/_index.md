This is my personal blog made just to test blogging and various technical solutions.  

I work in the thankfully public health IT sector in Norway, and I like (and will probably blog about):  
- Trail/ultra running,  
- music (guitar based),  
- tech in general
- programming, I guess?  

At some point I would like to self-host this blog from home.

This blog is written in Neovim on Arch Linux (possibly in WSL if I'm on my work machine).
