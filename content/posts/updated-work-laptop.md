So it finally happened, my managed work laptop was updated to Windows 11.  

I don't like it, but what else is new? I'm forced to have the taskbar/dock thing on the bottom of the screen, but I'm used to having it to the left.
I know you can use some registry hack to move it, but I'm not going to do that. For now ...  

What I really should have done is ask for a Linux machine instead. At some point in the hopefully near future I'll get that done, but I'm not sure it's worth the hassle all the while I'm stuck in the .NET world.

I did manage to write some Go at work last year, and I would like to see more of that.
